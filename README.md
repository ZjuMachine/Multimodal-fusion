abstract = {Amid the critical issue of water leakage in pipeline systems, deep learning-based acoustic detection methods have gained attention. However, these methods often rely on single-modality data and focus mainly on classification, leaving a gap in accurate pressure wave-based regression detection in complex conditions. A Bayesian‑optimized multimodal fusion deep‑learning framework (LRnet) has been developed, integrating pipeline parameters, operational conditions, and time‑as well as frequency‑domain pressure‑wave features. LRnet leverages a two-stage feature extraction process enhanced by the image information extraction module and the channel and spatial attention block. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-head attention mechanism to establish cross-domain correlations, thereby improving detection accuracy under complex operational conditions. For leakage position and rate predictions, the model proposed achieved overall coefficient of determination value of 0.88 on the test set. Ablation studies demonstrate that our multimodal fusion framework achieves superior leak localization and diagnosis performance, with the tri-modal model outperforming dual-modal combinations, improving leak location prediction by 17.9 % and leak volume by 7.7 %. Transfer learning assessments showed that while fine-tuned Residual Network 18 and Visual Geometry Group 16 models perform well, our model trained from scratch demonstrated comparable generalization with better computational efficiency, making it ideal for resource-constrained scenarios. An innovative approach is introduced, enhancing pipeline system reliability through advanced data integration. All data will be made publicly available, fostering future research in real-time water resource management, intelligent monitoring systems, and multimodal deep learning real-time, high-precision diagnostic applications.}
